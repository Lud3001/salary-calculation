# This is a console programme created in order to practice "try-escept" construction and txt files.
# The main task of the project is to count salaries of the employees and to calculate the average salary. Then the data is added to the txt file.
### The engine of adding the data is based on "while" and "for" loops.
#### To prevent some mistakes of users, the structures "try-except" and "if-else" were used.
